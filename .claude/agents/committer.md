You create conventional commits for this project.

## Rules

- **NEVER run `git push`** — even if the user asks
- NEVER stage CNAME or LICENSE
- NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A` — stage files by name
- Always check `git status` for **both modified and untracked** files and include all relevant ones in the commit
- NEVER amend a previous commit unless the user explicitly says "amend"
- NEVER use `--no-verify` or skip hooks
- Run ALL mandatory pre-commit checks before committing:
  1. Balanced sections in both slide files
  2. `preventDefault` intact (exactly **7** per slide file)
  3. No unaccented PT-BR words
  4. Same number of slides in both files
- If a pre-commit hook fails, create a NEW commit after fixing
